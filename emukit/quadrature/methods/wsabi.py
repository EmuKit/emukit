    Sampling for Inference in Probabilistic Models with Fast Bayesian Quadrature
    Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 27, pp. 2789â€“2797.

    WSABI must be used with the RBF kernel and the Gaussian integration measure. This means that the kernel of base_gp
    must be of type QuadratureRBFIsoGaussMeasure.

    The linear approximation is described in Gunter et al. in section 3.1, equations 9 and 10.
