    "Emukit tutorials can be added and used through the links below. The goal on these tutorials is to explain a particular functionality of Emukit. These tutorials are stand alone notebooks that don't require any extra file and fully sit on Emukit components (apart from the creation of the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tutorials have been written with the purpose of explaining some scientific concepts and can be used for learning about different topics in emulation and uncertainty quantification. Other tutorials are a small guide to describe some feature of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great resource to learn Emukit are the [examples](../emukit/examples) which are more elaborated modules focused either on the implementation of a new method with Emukit components or on the analysis and solution of some specific problem."
